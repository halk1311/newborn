Hi! 
My name is Alyona and I am on my way to becoming an ML-engineer :) 

Here I am going to collect examples of small projects which suit best to illustrate my coding skills

The very first project of mine is related with data mining and simple interactive window. [Here](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn#:~:text=%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0_%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2.ipynb)

The latest finished project of mine involves ML model for classification of the text. The data I used were parsed, the code for data mining is [here](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn#:~:text=%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0_%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2.ipynb) and the ML project itself can be found [here](https://github.com/halk1311/newborn#:~:text=6%20months%20ago-,Finals.ipynb,-Add%20files%20via). It was used as the final project for HSE NLP course.

Nowadays I practice the skills on Kaggle and soon I will upload my Titanic (what a surprise!) notebook as well :)
